###Introduction###

This project consists of implementing a simple compiler for the so called LITTLE programming language. 
The LITTLE language is a toy programming language designed solely for this course and it's based on the MICRO language described in the course text book.

###Running the compiler###

Making the compiler

    make clean; make compiler

Testing the Compiler

    ./Micro test.micro > <output file>

###Testing your generated code###

For project steps 4â€“7, the compiler can be tested by running your generated code through the Tiny simulator, a program that simulates a machine that supports the Tiny instruction set.
